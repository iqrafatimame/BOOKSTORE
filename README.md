# BOOKSTORE ðŸ“š
  Book Store Organization System is a very simple project that can help a small
bookstore to manage all the books. It is build in C# by using window forms. It uses SQL
Database to store its data. To use this system, you must signup and login to the system.
Once you are signed up, you just need to login every time you visit the system. In this
system, there are two modes: admin mode and user mode. In admin mode, users can add,
delete, update and view books. While in user mode, users can view books by category and
search books.
